# HTTP-Server
This is a simple http server in c++ , currently this works for localhost:8000 , would upgrade this in future.


The client is actually you web browser. 

Keep all you website data into a folder named "data"(NO SUBFOLDERS INSIDE) and place the main binary next to the data folder and then run the main program then open your web browser and navigate to "localhost:8000" , there you should see your website being served.
